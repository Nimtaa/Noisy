***Repository of my Bachelor Thesis Project ðŸŽ“ Driver Behavior Recognition, using Inertial Signals***

I am continually updating the repo, the following is a to-do like list â˜•

- [x] Working with [Driver Behavior Dataset](https://github.com/jair-jr/driverBehaviorDataset)
	- [x] Creating index from timestamps
	- [x] Finding patterns of the basic driving actions
	- [x] Feature extraction aggressive actions
- [x] Collecting driving data
- [x] Transferring the coordinate system from device to Earth
- [x] Developing classification algorithms using LSTM Networks to detect driving actions
- [x] Post-processing
	- [x] Extracting valid events
	- [x] Determining the severity of events
	- [x] Designing a statistical model to score driving journey
